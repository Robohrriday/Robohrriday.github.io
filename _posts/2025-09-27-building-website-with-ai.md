# Building a Personal Website with AI: A Complete Guide

Ever wondered how AI can help you build a complete website from scratch? I recently built this very website you're reading with the help of GitHub Copilot and AI agents, and the experience was fascinating. Let me walk you through the entire process, from initial generation to the final touches.

## The Challenge: Starting from Zero

I wanted to create a minimal, professional personal website that would serve as both a portfolio and a blog. The requirements were simple:
- Clean, minimal design inspired by Gregory Gundersen's website
- Jekyll-based for GitHub Pages hosting
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Easy to maintain and extend

Instead of starting from scratch, I decided to leverage AI to accelerate the development process.

## Phase 1: The AI-Generated Foundation

### Using GitHub Copilot for Initial Scaffolding

The magic began with GitHub Copilot's ability to generate entire project structures based on a simple prompt. Here's what happened:

**Initial Request**: *"Create a minimal personal portfolio website inspired by Gregory Gundersen theme"*

**What Copilot Generated**:
- Complete Jekyll project structure
- 498 lines of code across 10 files
- Professional CSS styling (221 lines)
- HTML layouts and templates
- Configuration files and dependencies

The initial commit by `copilot-swe-agent[bot]` created:

```
├── _config.yml           # Jekyll configuration
├── _layouts/
│   └── default.html      # Main layout template
├── _includes/
│   └── nav.html         # Navigation component
├── _posts/
│   └── 2024-09-26-welcome-to-my-blog.md
├── css/
│   └── main.css         # Complete styling (221 lines!)
├── index.html           # Homepage
├── about.html           # About page
├── blog.html            # Blog listing page
├── Gemfile              # Ruby dependencies
└── .gitignore          # Git ignore rules
```

### The Power of Reference-Based Generation

What impressed me most was how Copilot understood the reference to "Gregory Gundersen theme" and generated code that actually captured the essence of that minimal, typography-focused design. The generated CSS included:

- Clean typography using system fonts
- Minimal color palette with subtle grays
- Responsive grid layouts
- Proper spacing and hierarchy
- Mobile-first responsive design

This demonstrates a key advantage of AI-assisted development: **the ability to generate complete, coherent codebases based on design references or existing patterns**.

## Phase 2: Iterative Refinement with AI Assistance

After the initial generation, I spent time refining the website through multiple iterations, each guided by AI assistance. Here's what the commit history reveals:

### The Refinement Process

Looking at the commit history from `copilot/fix-0588e45a-5a90-45b0-a1f2-bf11ad7be971`, I can see the iterative nature of AI-assisted development:

1. **Initial Generation** (Sept 26): Copilot created the complete foundation
2. **Content Customization** (Sept 27): Modified `index.html` and CSS for personal branding
3. **Typography Improvements**: Added Lato and Montserrat fonts
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Fixed navigation alignment on mobile devices
5. **Design Polish**: Adjusted margins, spacing, and removed list bullets
6. **Icon Integration**: Added favicon support for professional appearance

### Key Improvements Made

**Typography Enhancement**:
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap');

html {
  font-family: 'Montserrat', 'Lato', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

**Mobile Navigation Fix**:
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  .nav ul li {
    display: inline;  /* Changed from block to maintain horizontal layout */
    margin-right: 15px;
  }
}
```

**Clean List Styling**:
```css
.home ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
```

## Phase 3: Advanced AI Integration with GitHub MCP

### What is GitHub MCP?

The most powerful part of this workflow came from integrating the **GitHub Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**, which enables AI agents to directly interact with GitHub repositories. This isn't just about code generation—it's about complete repository management.

### Setting Up GitHub MCP Server

Here's how to set up the GitHub MCP server to enable AI agents to handle your entire Git workflow:

#### 1. Install the MCP Server

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

#### 2. Configure Authentication

Create a GitHub personal access token with these permissions:
- `repo` (full repository access)
- `workflow` (for GitHub Actions)
- `write:packages` (if using GitHub Packages)

Set up the environment variable:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token_here"
```

#### 3. Configure Your AI Assistant

Add the GitHub MCP server to your AI assistant's configuration. This enables the AI to:
- **Read repository contents**: Examine files, commit history, and project structure
- **Manage branches**: Create, switch, and merge branches
- **Handle commits**: Stage changes, create commits with meaningful messages
- **Push changes**: Automatically push commits to remote repositories
- **Manage pull requests**: Create, review, and merge PRs
- **Run workflows**: Trigger GitHub Actions and monitor builds

#### 4. The Magic: Hands-Off Git Operations

With GitHub MCP configured, I can simply ask the AI: *"Create a blog post about this project and push it to the repository"* — and it handles everything:

1. **Content Creation**: Generates the blog post markdown
2. **File Management**: Creates the file in the correct `_posts/` directory
3. **Git Operations**: Stages the changes, creates a commit, and pushes to the branch
4. **Repository Analysis**: Examines commit history to understand the project evolution

## What This Means for Development

### The New Development Paradigm

This experience showcases a fundamental shift in how we can approach web development:

**Traditional Approach**:
1. Research design patterns and frameworks
2. Set up project structure manually
3. Write HTML, CSS, and configuration files
4. Test and iterate through manual coding
5. Handle Git operations manually

**AI-Assisted Approach**:
1. Describe the desired outcome to AI
2. Review and refine the generated foundation
3. Guide AI through iterative improvements
4. Let AI handle routine Git operations
5. Focus on creative and strategic decisions

### Key Benefits Observed

1. **Speed**: What would have taken hours was accomplished in minutes
2. **Completeness**: AI generated comprehensive, production-ready code
3. **Best Practices**: The generated code followed modern web development standards
4. **Consistency**: All files maintained a cohesive style and structure
5. **Learning**: I learned about new CSS techniques and Jekyll features from the AI-generated code

### Limitations and Considerations

**What AI Excels At**:
- Generating boilerplate and foundational code
- Following established patterns and conventions
- Handling repetitive tasks and configurations
- Maintaining consistency across files

**What Still Requires Human Input**:
- Creative design decisions and branding
- Content creation and messaging
- User experience considerations
- Strategic technical decisions
- Quality assurance and testing

## Practical Tips for AI-Assisted Web Development

### 1. Start with Clear, Specific Prompts

Instead of: *"Make me a website"*
Try: *"Create a minimal Jekyll blog inspired by [specific reference] with responsive design"*

### 2. Leverage Reference-Based Generation

AI works best when given concrete examples or references. Mentioning established designs or frameworks helps generate more coherent results.

### 3. Use Iterative Refinement

Don't expect perfection on the first try. Use AI for multiple small improvements rather than one massive generation.

### 4. Combine Multiple AI Tools

- **GitHub Copilot**: For initial generation and code completion
- **AI Chat Assistants**: For iterative improvements and problem-solving
- **GitHub MCP**: For repository management and Git operations

### 5. Maintain Version Control

Always work in branches when experimenting with AI-generated code. This allows you to easily revert changes and compare different approaches.

## The Future of AI-Assisted Development

This project represents just the beginning of what's possible with AI-assisted development. As these tools become more sophisticated, we can expect:

- **More sophisticated project generation**: AI that understands complex architectural patterns
- **Better context awareness**: AI that learns from your existing codebase and preferences
- **Integrated deployment**: AI that can handle not just development but also CI/CD and deployment
- **Real-time collaboration**: AI that can work alongside developers in real-time

## Conclusion

Building this website with AI assistance was both efficient and educational. The combination of GitHub Copilot for initial generation, AI assistants for iterative improvement, and GitHub MCP for repository management created a seamless development experience.

**The key takeaway**: AI doesn't replace developers—it amplifies our capabilities. It handles the routine, repetitive tasks while allowing us to focus on creativity, strategy, and user experience.

Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to accelerate your workflow or someone new to web development seeking a head start, AI-assisted development offers compelling advantages. The technology is here, it's accessible, and it's ready to transform how we build for the web.
